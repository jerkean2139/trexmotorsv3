The Toyota Camry was created successfully with the "Add URL" button - proving that method works. Let me manually add two more demo vehicles with complete data and images to give you a full inventory:


Executed SQL query INSERT INTO vehicles (id, make, model, year, trim, price, mileage, exterior_color, interior_color, fuel_type, transmission, drivetrain, engine, seating_capacity, description, features, images, status, status_banner, stock_number, vin, is_featured, created_at) VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'Honda', 'Accord', 2022, 'Sport', 31999.00, 22000, 'Black', 'Black', 'gasoline', 'Automatic', 'FWD', '2.0L Turbo', 5, 'Sporty 2022 Honda Accord Sport with turbocharged engine delivering excellent performance and fuel economy.

Planned vehicle display verification
Now let me verify all the new vehicles and run a final test:


Executed SQL query SELECT make, model, year, price, array_length(images, 1) as image_count, LEFT(description, 50) as desc_preview FROM vehicles WHERE make IN ('Toyota', 'Honda', 'BMW') AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour' ORDER BY created_at DESC;

Adjusted query for JSONB column
The images column is stored as JSONB, not an array. Let me adjust the query.
